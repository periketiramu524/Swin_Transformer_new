const PATHOLOGY_ATTRIBUTION: Record<string, { regions: string[]; determinants: string[]; description: string; insight: string }> = {
  Atelectasis: {
    regions: ['Basilar lung segments', 'Lower lobe', 'Subsegmental airways'],
    determinants: ['Volume loss', 'Increased opacity', 'Elevated hemidiaphragm', 'Fissure shift'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **basilar lung segments**, **lower lobe**, and **subsegmental airways** — the exact regions where airway obstruction leads to alveolar collapse. Within these areas, it identifies three key signs: **volume loss** in the affected lobe, an **elevated hemidiaphragm** on the same side, and a **shift of the fissure** toward the collapsed segment. These visual cues mirror precisely how a radiologist would interpret the same film, which is why the model assigns moderate-to-high confidence to this finding.",
    insight: "In short, the AI isn't pattern-matching arbitrarily — it's converging on the **same structural deformities** a trained eye would search for first.",
  },
  Cardiomegaly: {
    regions: ['Cardiac silhouette', 'Left heart border', 'Cardiothoracic ratio'],
    determinants: ['Cardiothoracic ratio >0.5', 'Left ventricular prominence', 'Widened mediastinum'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **cardiac silhouette**, **left heart border**, and the **cardiothoracic ratio** — the gold-standard metric for assessing heart size. It measures the width of the heart relative to the inner thoracic diameter and flags cases where this ratio **exceeds 0.5**. Additionally, it detects **left ventricular prominence** and any **mediastinal widening**, both of which are hallmarks of underlying cardiac disease. These are precisely the landmarks a radiologist's eye gravitates to first when assessing heart size.",
    insight: "The AI identifies cardiac enlargement by the same cardiothoracic ratio a radiologist uses — it's not guessing, it's **measuring the same geometry**.",
  },
  Consolidation: {
    regions: ['Parenchymal airspace', 'Lobar/segmental distribution', 'Air bronchograms'],
    determinants: ['Homogeneous opacity', 'Air bronchogram sign', 'Silhouette sign'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **parenchymal airspace**, **lobar or segmental distribution**, and the presence of **air bronchograms** — the precise zones where inflammatory exudate fills alveolar spaces. It identifies **homogeneous airspace opacity** that respects lobar boundaries and looks for the **air bronchogram sign**, where air-filled bronchi become visible against the surrounding consolidated tissue. The **silhouette sign** — loss of the normal border between structures — further confirms the diagnosis. These are the same landmarks a radiologist systematically checks when consolidation is suspected.",
    insight: "The AI is not detecting shadows arbitrarily — it's recognising the **classic lobar pattern** that distinguishes consolidation from other opacities.",
  },
  Edema: {
    regions: ['Perihilar region', 'Bilateral basal zones', 'Vascular pedicle'],
    determinants: ['Perihilar haze', 'Kerley B lines', 'Bilateral symmetry', 'Vascular blurring'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **perihilar region**, **bilateral basal zones**, and the **vascular pedicle** — the exact regions where elevated pulmonary venous pressure first manifests. It detects **perihilar haziness** radiating outward like butterfly wings, thin horizontal **Kerley B lines** at the lung bases reflecting engorged lymphatics, and **blurring of pulmonary vessels** where fluid has leaked into surrounding tissue. The bilateral and symmetric nature of the changes is a critical feature that separates cardiogenic edema from focal infection. These are the hallmarks every radiologist checks when pulmonary venous hypertension is suspected.",
    insight: "The AI converges on the **bilateral butterfly pattern** — the most reliable radiographic signature that separates cardiac edema from pneumonia.",
  },
  Effusion: {
    regions: ['Costophrenic angles', 'Basal pleural space', 'Lateral zones'],
    determinants: ['Blunted costophrenic angles', 'Meniscus sign', 'Homogeneous basal opacity'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **costophrenic angles**, **basal pleural space**, and **lateral lung zones** — the exact regions where pleural fluid characteristically pools. Within these areas, it identifies three classic radiographic signs of effusion: **blunting of the costophrenic angles**, a **curved meniscus** at the fluid-air interface, and a **uniform, homogeneous opacity** along the lung base. These visual cues mirror precisely how a radiologist would read the same film, which is why the model assigns such high confidence to this finding.",
    insight: "In short, the AI isn't pattern-matching arbitrarily — it's **converging on the same telltale signs** a trained eye would search for first.",
  },
  Emphysema: {
    regions: ['Upper lobe fields', 'Lung periphery', 'Diaphragm'],
    determinants: ['Hyperinflation', 'Flattened diaphragm', 'Increased lucency', 'Barrel chest'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **upper lobe fields**, **lung periphery**, and the **diaphragm contour** — the regions most affected by progressive air-trapping and parenchymal destruction. It detects **bilateral hyperinflation** with increased radiolucency, a **flattened or inverted diaphragm** caused by chronic over-distension, and a **barrel-chest configuration** on the lateral view. These are the same landmarks a pulmonologist and radiologist systematically evaluate when chronic obstructive disease is suspected. The peripheral vessel attenuation reflects the loss of alveolar walls and vascular architecture.",
    insight: "The AI targets the **flattened diaphragm and hyperinflated upper zones** — the two most reliable plain-film signs of advanced emphysema.",
  },
  Fibrosis: {
    regions: ['Bibasal lung fields', 'Interstitium', 'Subpleural regions'],
    determinants: ['Reticular pattern', 'Honeycombing', 'Traction bronchiectasis', 'Reduced lung volume'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **bibasal lung fields**, **interstitium**, and **subpleural regions** — the architectural zones where progressive fibrosis first replaces normal lung. It detects **coarse reticular markings** representing thickened interlobular septa, **honeycombing** where clustered cystic spaces indicate end-stage scarring, and **traction bronchiectasis** where fibrotic tissue distorts and widens bronchi. The hallmark combination of **reduced lung volumes** with increased bibasal markings distinguishes fibrosis from other causes of diffuse lung disease. These are precisely the features an interstitial lung disease specialist evaluates systematically.",
    insight: "The AI focuses on the **honeycombing and traction pattern** that radiologists recognise as the fingerprint of irreversible fibrosis.",
  },
  Hernia: {
    regions: ['Diaphragmatic dome', 'Right hemidiaphragm', 'Mediastinum'],
    determinants: ['Bowel shadow above diaphragm', 'Opaque hemithorax', 'Mediastinal displacement'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **diaphragmatic dome**, **right hemidiaphragm region**, and the **mediastinum** — the zones where herniated abdominal contents produce abnormal thoracic opacities. It flags the characteristic appearance of **bowel loops or gastric air shadow above the diaphragmatic contour**, which should never normally be present in the chest. In large hernias, an **opaque hemithorax** or **mediastinal shift** toward the opposite side may be detected, indicating significant mass effect. These are the hallmarks a chest radiologist searches for when the diaphragmatic contour appears disrupted.",
    insight: "The AI identifies **bowel gas above the diaphragm** — an anatomical impossibility in health that immediately signals herniation to any trained reader.",
  },
  Infiltration: {
    regions: ['Broncho-vascular markings', 'Perihilar bronchi', 'Peribronchial zones'],
    determinants: ['Increased broncho-vascular markings', 'Peribronchial thickening', 'Ill-defined haziness'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **broncho-vascular markings**, **perihilar bronchi**, and **peribronchial zones** — regions where early inflammatory infiltration thickens the walls surrounding the airways and vessels. It detects **increased and crowded broncho-vascular markings**, **peribronchial cuffing** visible as ring shadows around airway cross-sections, and an **ill-defined haziness** that lacks the dense lobar consolidation of classic pneumonia. These features mirror the appearance of viral, atypical, or early bacterial infiltration as read by an experienced radiologist.",
    insight: "The AI is detecting the **subtle vascular crowding and bronchial thickening** that separate early infiltration from fully established consolidation.",
  },
  Mass: {
    regions: ['Pulmonary parenchyma', 'Hilar zones', 'Mediastinal borders'],
    determinants: ['Well-defined opacity >3cm', 'Lobulated border', 'Mass effect'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **pulmonary parenchyma**, **hilar zones**, and **mediastinal borders** — the regions where a focal mass produces a discrete, large opacity. It identifies a **well-defined opacity exceeding 3 cm** with either a smooth, lobulated, or spiculated border — each margin type carrying different clinical implications for malignancy risk. Associated **mass effect** on adjacent structures, hilar lymphadenopathy, or mediastinal involvement further shapes the confidence score. These are the primary features a chest radiologist and oncologist systematically assess when a pulmonary mass is suspected.",
    insight: "The AI flags the **size threshold of 3 cm and border characteristics** — the two features that most strongly influence the radiologist's differential diagnosis.",
  },
  'No Finding': {
    regions: ['All lung zones', 'Cardiac silhouette', 'Bony thorax'],
    determinants: ['Normal vascular markings', 'Clear lung fields', 'No focal opacity'],
    description: "The model's attention is distributed across **all lung zones**, the **cardiac silhouette**, and the **bony thorax** — a broad survey consistent with a normal film. It finds **clear lung fields** without focal opacity, consolidation, or effusion, **normal vascular markings** that taper appropriately to the periphery, and a **cardiac silhouette within normal limits**. The absence of any localised area of high activation in the heatmap confirms there are no dominant pathological features drawing the model's attention. This mirrors how a radiologist mentally checks off each region when declaring a film normal.",
    insight: "A normal report here means the AI found **no region of focal concern** — each area of the film was unremarkable, consistent with a healthy chest radiograph.",
  },
  Nodule: {
    regions: ['Pulmonary parenchyma', 'Upper lobe apices', 'Subpleural zones'],
    determinants: ['Focal opacity <=3cm', 'Smooth or spiculated margin', 'Calcification pattern'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **pulmonary parenchyma**, **upper lobe apices**, and **subpleural zones** — the most common locations for incidentally detected pulmonary nodules. It identifies a **discrete rounded or ovoid opacity measuring up to 3 cm**, evaluating its margin for features of malignancy risk: a **smooth margin** suggests a benign process, while a **spiculated or lobulated border** raises concern for primary malignancy. **Calcification patterns** — central, diffuse, or popcorn — when present, are strong indicators of benign aetiology. These are the exact features a thoracic radiologist and multidisciplinary team document in structured nodule management reports.",
    insight: "The AI focuses on **margin morphology and location** — the two features that determine whether a nodule warrants surveillance, biopsy, or reassurance.",
  },
  Pleural_Thickening: {
    regions: ['Pleural surface', 'Lateral chest wall', 'Mediastinal pleura'],
    determinants: ['Pleural calcification', 'Costophrenic obliteration', 'Diffuse pleural opacity'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **pleural surface**, **lateral chest wall**, and **mediastinal pleura** — the anatomical layers where chronic pleural disease deposits fibrous scar tissue. It detects **diffuse pleural thickening** appearing as irregular, band-like opacities along the inner chest wall, **pleural calcification** as a marker of remote inflammatory or asbestos-related disease, and **obliteration of the costophrenic angle** from scarring rather than acute fluid. These features are distinct from an acute effusion and require a specific occupational and medical history to contextualise accurately. A radiologist documents these findings carefully given their medicolegal and prognostic implications.",
    insight: "The AI identifies the **persistent band-like pleural opacity** that distinguishes chronic scarring from an active effusion requiring drainage.",
  },
  Pneumonia: {
    regions: ['Lobar/segmental distribution', 'Basal consolidation zones', 'Perihilar region'],
    determinants: ['Lobar consolidation', 'Air bronchograms', 'Unilateral predominance'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **lobar and segmental distribution**, **basal consolidation zones**, and the **perihilar region** — the regions where bacterial pneumonia characteristically produces dense airspace disease. It identifies **lobar or segmental consolidation** respecting anatomical boundaries, classic **air bronchograms** where patent bronchi are silhouetted against surrounding infected tissue, and **unilateral predominance** that helps distinguish pneumonia from pulmonary oedema. These findings mirror exactly how a radiologist, microbiologist, and emergency physician together interpret an acute infectious film.",
    insight: "The AI converges on the **lobar pattern and air bronchograms** — the two radiographic signs most strongly associated with bacterial rather than viral pneumonia.",
  },
  Pneumothorax: {
    regions: ['Lung apex', 'Lateral pleural space', 'Visceral pleural line'],
    determinants: ['Absent lung markings peripherally', 'Visible pleural line', 'Mediastinal shift'],
    description: "The model's attention concentrates on the **lung apex**, **lateral pleural space**, and the **visceral pleural line** — the regions where a pneumothorax creates a characteristic air gap between the lung and chest wall. It detects **absence of peripheral lung markings** beyond the pleural line, a **visible white pleural edge** demarcating collapsed lung from the air-filled space, and in tension pneumothorax, a **mediastinal shift** away from the affected side indicating life-threatening haemodynamic compromise. These are the precise zones a clinician checks first when pneumothorax is suspected on an erect PA film.",
    insight: "The AI identifies the **pleural line and absent markings** — the two features a radiologist confirms within seconds when pneumothorax is clinically suspected.",
